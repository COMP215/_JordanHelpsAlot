README

Note:
Hello professor! As I'm writing this note it is about 5:30 on Friday and I do not have my code anywhere near where I would actually like it to be. What currently works: 
	-My prim graph is fully working and Danny and I spent a lot of time testing and working this one through. However, as it is now, the unfinished code has to be commented out 
	-My Kruskal's is complete only in that my psuedo code (written as comments) is fully worked out - however because of the way I wrote it (big picture) it's being a nightmare to test. Also two functions I refer to haven't been written yet but they are pretty straight forward
	-Djikstra's is nowhere but I have a strong grasp on the psuedo-code and know exactly what I need to do
Basically, what I mean to say by all this is I understand if my grade suffers because of the shape of my code at the moment. What I want you to know though is that I didn't put this off, I've been working consistently to get it done (impeded by a colossal Programming Languages project, which I'm sure you've already heard complaints related to), and it will get done, because I feel like this is what's most important to you. So here is my code as it stands now. Thanks and have a good weekend.

Compilation Instructions:
	(0. comment out problem code-> everything within Kruskal function, uncomment Prim test graphs.)
	1. Open directory of files in terminal
	2. Modify vertices and edges in main.cpp, and call Graph Viz function on new graph
	3. "make graph"
	4. "./graph"
	5. Open output file
