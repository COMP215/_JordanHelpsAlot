Graphs:
	-G = ( V, E )
	-V = set of vertices (nodes)
	-E = set of edges
-Graphs are represented as pictures
-set: a collection of objects where each element is unique and order doesn't matter
-arrows: indicate a directed graph (no arrows means it goes both ways within DG)
-Example:
	-G = (V,E)
	-V = {A,B,C,D}
	-E = {(A,C),(C,A),(C,D)... (2^8 pairs)}

-How do we store a graph in memory?
	-Matrix: Makes sense, but can become inefficient
	-Adjacency List:
		-A : {B, C}
		-B : {A, D}  etc...
